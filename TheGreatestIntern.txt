In a land of codes and circuits wide,
Where computers hummed with digital pride,
There lived a user, carefree and bold,
Whose unlocked computer held stories untold.

This user, you see, was unaware,
Of the lurking intern, scheming with flair.
With nimble fingers and eyes aglow,
They spied the open door, ready to bestow.

Through cyber paths, they ventured deep,
Bypassing defenses, no time to sleep.
Like a phantom, they glided unseen,
Exploring files with a mischievous sheen.

They unraveled secrets, encrypted and tight,
In the realm of data, a curious delight.
The intern laughed, their triumph complete,
For the user's pride, they now did deplete.
